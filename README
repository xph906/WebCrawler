1. Enter all the urls in file data/url_list
2. Create XPI file. 
		1). If you have Firefox SDK installed, do "cfx xpi" and then you have a file called cralwler.xpi
		2). Or us zip to compress the folder and rename it to xx.xpi.

3. Once having it installed, you can find three icons in the right corner of  		
	Firefox,click the left one.
